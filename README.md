# A small snake eater with C language

## Why Make This

To Kill time one day, I just downloaded a snake eater game from iphone AppStore and played for almost 5 hours. And I realised that maybe I can write this game with just C language, So I wrote this.

## How to compile this code

You can open Snake.c in any C compiler within Windows environment and compile this code, and to play this game.

Any questions to dongtuoc@yeah.net please.
