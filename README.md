# A small snake eater with C language

## Why Make This

To Kill time one day, I just downloaded a snake eater game from iphone AppStore and played for almost 5 hours. And I realised that maybe I can write this game with just C language, So I wrote this.

## How to compile this code

You can run 
```bash
./build.sh
```
to compile this code to a binary executable file, named Snake. And run
```
./Snake
``` 
in a Windows environment to play this game.
